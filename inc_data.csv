Let's be honest--the old recruiter model is inefficient and no longer represents what nursing professionals need. Nurses are sophisticated consumers. They know how to quickly and effectively research online. When it comes to partnering with a staffing firm, they know how and where to do their research. There is a lot of power in that research, and ultimately it will drive their decision on the agency they partner with. Only the best recruiters will earn the trust and respect of the nurses who put their heart and soul into their profession. Our recruiters have to prove themselves, and show they legitimately care about their nurses' career advancement and growth. Atlas is focused on being the very best at matching great people to great facilities. We have worked very hard to build a brand that emphasizes our ability to eliminate the headaches of the job search and provide our traveling nurses with the very best opportunities available. That's the Atlas difference. Together we can do amazing things.

They soon learned, however, that there was a much bigger business opportunity with a different customer segment: Instead of individuals, they could help fast-growing startups that needed to outsource customer service and back-office operations. Using their last $22,000, the two set up shop in a cheap office in Santa Monica, California, and started building their work force in the Philippines. Today, TaskUs has more than 5,200 employees and handles outsourcing for some of the biggest companies on the Web--including Groupon, Tinder, AutoDesk, and Whisper. Part of what has made TaskUs so successful is how the company has changed the working culture in an industry known for commoditizing employees. Its offices offer fitness centers, massages, open floor plans, and cafeterias. As a result, TaskUs boasts a lower attrition rate (14 percent) than the average outsourcing center in the Philippines (25 to 30 percent).Note: All data as of 1/31/16

We do lunches together, go out to happy hour, share life events, losses, wins, and so on. We have inside jokes and office dance parties. We celebrate every little win and motivate through every loss. Even as the number of our employees grows, things stay the same. Our groups and support systems just become larger. All of this is because the founders, Scott Wehner and Sam Wageman, created Fusion on three core values: humility, drive, and a positive attitude. The staffing and health care industries can lead to burn-out quickly and often. Our founders have created a place where your ideas and concerns are heard. They are willing to try new things if it can better the company, and our employees are always thinking of the good of the company. The founders always ask about staff needs and wants and do their best to address them. We love to embrace open conflict and open communication. Without it, no company can truly operate to its fullest potential.

In the kitchen, employees have access to a variety of snacks, quick lunch options, coffees, juices, soda and water. Down the hall, there is a TV and game console to allow employees to take a break and clear their mind when needed. Additionally, as a small organization, the executives are heavily involved with the day to day operations and are always accessible and willing to provide their expertise to anyone that asks. Employees are also able to learn, grow and more importantly, cross train if they prefer. There are times when one may feel stagnant in their role, want to learn another job because of its increased demand, or just interested in expanding their personal knowledge. Many employees have come into the organization in one role however have requested to cross train in a completely different area and thus transitioned into a role within that new focus. We value people and help them to positively affect others through their work in providing technology that improves healthcare.

You are part of a team that works together effectively and efficiently and strives to take things off of each other's plates rather than adding to them. We're lean by design. There is no bureaucracy here and everyone is given the freedom to work autonomously, partly due to the fact that our team is comprised of exceptionally talented and conscientious individuals. But we realize it's easy to take on too much and get overwhelmed. We advocate for people to ask for help when they need it. We believe sharing your 'how to do it right' and 'how I did it wrong' stories can provide valuable learning opportunities for teammates. Above all, transparency and fairness are at the core of who we are and what we do. This applies to how we treat our team members and partners. These principles engender trust and we encourage everyone to communicate openly and often. Our open office space lends itself to real-time conversations and solutions. At MediaAlpha, there is no need to try to 'fit in'. We recognize that our success is a result of our amazing, talented and diverse team.

A focus of the company's office life is coming together regularly as a "family." For example, lunch is hosted every Friday, where every employee in the New York office comes to eat together, enjoy each other's company, and share news about the company and projects they are working on. Payoneer is proud to house employees from all over the globe, and it is important for the company to acknowledge this and help people feel at home. One way the office achieves this is by celebrating non-U.S. holidays and having a range of snacks and entertainment activities to make the team feel comfortable. In order to ensure that the company fosters an environment inclusion and creativity, Payoneer has instituted a "No-Jerk Policy" in its hiring practices. This policy aims to promote a culture of openness and equality, where employees aren't afraid to take risks and possibly fail.

How do you quantify being able to work in yoga pants, or greeting your child when they get off the bus, or just being able to answer email in your favorite armchair? Our engineers are empowered to do whatever it takes to make things right when they are onsite with a customer. This attitude allows our employees to act in the right way without delay or approval, including purchasing items or doing work outside the original project scope. Davenport Group has stated values, but more important, the company and its management live these values every day. We talk about our culture, and we walk the walk. We are family-friendly and offer unlimited PTO, yet what really makes us different is that we treat people like adults and don't burden them with rules and restrictions beyond "take care of the customer."

Our leadership team does all we can to build a best place to work, keep employees engaged, and listen to feedback from all channels to pivot often and quickly. For us, culture is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Our culture is dynamic, while still remaining based on our Hanapin core values of Reliability, Integrity, Creativity, Hana-thusiasm, and Resourcefulness.

Two staff members are dedicated to the Culture Team and keeping the company true to its founding principles in all internal decisions. Curiosity, Happiness, Integrity and Teamwork (CHIT) make up those values and can be seen in conversations on a daily occurrence. Employees do not undergo an annual review, but participate in CHIT-Chats, one-on-one conversations with the CEO and Founder about their personal growth and dreams. Each employee is tasked with setting personal goals, and they are placed in a "Power Couple" with a teammate outside of their department where they can touch base and check in regularly. Happy Medium employees are encouraged to keep growing and remain curious through Happy Medium University where employees can volunteer to give a lunch workshop on tips they've learned through their own avenues. Founder Katie Patterson was able to see that when the company operated on a 7:30-5 schedule (with an early out at 2:30 on Fridays), not all employees were at their peak performance. Flex schedules were quickly introduced to allow each employee cater their day to when they felt they were most productive.

Walker Sands is filled with brilliant, determined marketing scientists, but our culture revolves around more than just work.

To provide the best customer service, we believe that we must provide the best work environment. Squaremouth offers perks like unlimited paid vacation and mandatory birthdays off, with a $200 beer bonus. To make sure all employees utilize their unlimited vacation, the company implemented a mandatory minimum of 10 vacation days per year. Employees have rapid growth opportunities, and the ability to build themselves a new job if desired. If employees feel they deserve a raise, they present their case to the company. Everyone gets one vote, including the CEO, and if they receive a majority vote, they get the raise. This policy is in place so employees work for the respect of their peers, not just their boss. All employees are expected to perform at a high level. If they need a personal day to recharge, it's encouraged. With these benefits in place, among others--including surprise Apple Watches for employees and quarterly bonuses based on profits--Squaremouth has maintained a high level of customer service and has grown to more than $17 million in annual sales in 2016.

We believe that our employees are our biggest asset, and provide a work environment that is both challenging and fun. Some things that set us apart from a traditional consulting firm are our belief in non-client facing time and work. We make a point of taking time to get together in weekly, company-wide, creative meetings led by a different staff person each week on whatever topic they choose. We hold monthly staff meetings where we present the "Egg Award" to a different staff member each month in recognition of exceptional work, a great attitude, or going above and beyond. We host annual company parties, happy hours, picnics and other celebrations, all of which create an open, social environment that is based on both friendship and exceptional work. In addition, we provide unlimited PTO, profit sharing, and designated professional development funds for each employee. Each year CommunicateHealth evaluates its existing benefits and considers new options. This has recently resulted in the addition of an employee FSA program, commuter/public transit reimbursement, and an increase in the company contribution for family and partner health premiums.

Because we're employee-owned, our people are serious about getting it right every time. We put our people first, and place great importance on supporting employees, both professionally and personally. Our shared PTO policy allows employees to gift each other PTO days in situations where coworkers simply need more time for personal matters. One of the most significant things that Nina Hale offers is the employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), which makes the agency 100% employee-owned. The agency offers a three-year cliff-vesting schedule to ensure that employees don't have to wait years to benefit from this plan. Voices are heard, whether to celebrate a promotion or to register a complaint about fridge space. We celebrate each other's achievements both professionally (during our weekly recognition awards during the all-staff meeting) and personally (during our office-wide events like baby showers and bridal celebrations). To say our company culture is unique is an understatement, and we foster this spirit every chance we get. At least once a month we sponsor an all-company field trip or event to give employees the chance to unwind and get to know each other outside of work.

This starts in our office. Not only do we strive to make this an environment where people love to work, but also one that sets our employees up for success and personal growth. We do this by going above and beyond the traditional benefits most companies offer. Employees complete a strong 90-day onboarding process, participate in a performance-based profit sharing program that can add 5% or more to their income, and receive funds for monthly company outings where people come together with their families for an employee-planned event. One of our core values is 'Have a blast!' And we do. Every day. Our morning huddle doesn't start until someone shares a joke. Rocket IT's mission is to empower people through human connections and better IT. It's simple, but the way we do it is fulfilling for our team and game-changing for our clients.

Co-founders Amy Balliett and Nick Grant wanted to create a fun space to work, where everyone would feel welcome and where work would feel meaningful. Over the years, we've moved into bigger offices as we've expanded, and each of those offices has been outfitted by the employees themselves for maximum comfort and enjoyment. Amenities have included break rooms, free snacks, a climbing wall, pet-friendly offices, even a hidden bookcase door. Employees also enjoy a highly affordable health plan and access to both paid and unpaid time off, which allows them to take longer vacations than at most companies. It's probably not surprising, then, that many of Killers' first employees are still working at the company. Perhaps one of the biggest advantages of working at Killer is the opportunity to grow professionally. The company regularly funds opportunities for professional development, and encourages individuals to apply their unique set of talents to expand their role, or even shift into other roles within the company. Each person is encouraged to carve out a niche and make space for the company to grow along the way.

We are candid and up front with one another. (3) Anything is possible. We employ an entrepreneurial spirit. If you dream it, it can happen. (4) Everyone is creative. We have a creative company, not a creative department. A great idea can come from anyone, and we are all creative in our own way. (5) Our clients are smart. (6) Being choosy. We are willing to sever a relationship if the cost of doing business with them is too great. (7) Gratitude. Our clients have many choices in resources, and when they choose us, we are grateful. We have team outings and lots of fun, great benefits, and a casual environment, but our culture is ultimately about the people. Only with the right people can we have the right energy and collaboration to make our work strong, our office strong, and our future bright. We believe our employees--or "trees," as we call them--were brought together to learn, to grow, and to make magical things happen.

To Power, this means that people come before profits. We believe we now have the most effective leadership-development program in the nation, with the average entry-level worker entering management within three years. Further, we believe it is important to be present in the lives of our employees. Five years ago, we decided to push this vision into action and created a Special Events division whose only objective was to come up with event ideas to make employees happy. This has resulted in 140 events each year at go-kart facilities, driving ranges, and the movies. We also conclude each year with an all-expenses-paid trip to Cancun, Mexico, for every employee in the company and a guest. The goal? Team building that makes a large company feel intimate. Finally, we challenge each other. We believe in "no man left behind."

As such, we let our employees define the culture of InterWorks. This culture manifests itself in things like Nerf wars, Ping-Pong tournaments, afternoon drinks, and more. More than that, InterWorks is a great place to work because we let our employees define their own career paths. Above all, we want talented people at InterWorks. We'll never try to pigeonhole our employees to be something they're not. Instead, we work toward their strengths and let them lead the charge. This level of employee ownership makes for a strong sense of solidarity and definitely lets our employees relax, knowing that we're here to support them and their dreams. We do all we can to make those dreams a part of our business, and it has led to great things.

Top executives have established an open-door policy for all employees as one way to achieve these values. This policy requires transparency and the regular sharing of the company's financial data, along with growth and acquisition plans. Additionally, Optimal's COO holds weekly meetings with each of his direct reports and makes weekly personal "check in" calls to each person in the organization. Internal Spirit Days are held twice a year, during which team-building exercises are completed. Spirit Days help set and review individual, team, and corporate goals, and align them to the company's mission. All-company meetings are also held twice a month, which include acknowledging achievements, sharing news, and training. Our Catalytic Coaching process is aimed to drive professional and personal development among all employees. To further develop and discuss methods of enhancing team and organizational performance, a leadership committee, made up of all department managers, meets routinely. On an individual level, Optimal's managers conduct performance reviews, which account for employee satisfaction, retention, and profit, among others.

There are no cubicles; we skateboard to meetings, and standing desks and custom laptops are the norm. Departments work together in an open-concept space with the freedom to stream their playlists anytime. With a kegerator that's never dry of microbrews, a foosball table, impromptu dodgeball breakouts, and a dog-friendly policy, it's safe to say Imarc is a great place to work.
